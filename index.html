					<p>Throughout my years of being in leadership in numerous schools, I have initiated and organized partnerships with the schools below. It has not only provided a valuable platform to enhance the professional development among our teams: it has also provided us with opportunities to evaluate and improve our current systems, and brought in new ideas to implement at my current school. These relationships have also extended into new marketing opportunities and given us a better insight of the directions in our industries.</p>
					<p>I have independently and proactively sought and connected with elite international and private schools across Asia, China, Taiwan, Bangkok and Singapore, as well as taking our school into the Sister School Partnership scheme encouraged by the HKEDB.</p>

					<p>As an innovative leader in education, I am adept at looking into the situation and prioritizing the circumstances with honesty. I am aware of the selflessness I need to carry as innovation must be inclusive If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together. Despite all the cliche quotes of being a risk taker as a leader, I don’t agree to take a half-baked idea under the name of an “innovative spirit”. instead I take in the essence of being prepared to fail. Most of all, I pursue and value the trust of my most critical audience - the students. Without them the innovative will never come.</p>
					<p>One of the most significant innovations in education over the last decade has been the use of technology. In the classroom, this has given us the promise of individualized learning to maximise student potential, while outside of the classroom we have the chance of revolutionizing our school’s operational efficiency. As a leader in education, I am constantly reminding myself to be engaged and equipped in the new technologies and be connected with the new models.</p>

					<p>My experience in a variety of settings, cultures and countries has allowed me to familiar with different early childhood and primary curriculum. It has also allowed me to understand the culture differences and expectation embedded in the parenting and education philosophies.</p>
					<p>My experience in teaching also extends my observation and study throughout the secondary education and senior years of education. This unique profile has equipped me with a thorough understanding and insight on the journey of learning. It also allows me to have a deeper knowledge in understanding how learning takes place, cognitively, physically and emotionally.

                        I strongly believe that all students can achieve - but the nature of that achievement is as unique as they are. It is our responsibility as educators to create a space for each of our learners to explore themselves and the world, and develop their own unique sets of skills, talents and interests. To do this, I feel that teachers need to plan the learning experiences for our students that will both challenge and allow each student to think and grow, and to get the learning experience that best suits them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to make this happen, I feel educators must constantly construct and transform their own knowledge - we need to keep learning new tools, new methods and new theories and facts about psychology, education and a host of other disciplines that are relevant to the classroom where our learners spend their days. I strongly feel that one of my chief responsibilities is to be an effective diagnostician of students’ interests, abilities, and prior knowledge, as well as their weak areas, and to design learning opportunities that will work on their weaknesses and their strengths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I believe a teacher lives to serve. A teacher is dedicated to learning, to his or her discipline, to his or her students, and to making the future the best possible place for all of us to live. These are the challenges I accepted when I chose to be a teacher. I remain committed to them.
                    </p>
