# [projectsShowcase - A flat and clean portfolio site](https://davebza.github.io/portfolio/)
> This project is a method for showing my projects as a porfolio webpage. Hand-rolled, using a Bootstrap framework.

This site features a main image for branding, and then six cards for six portfolio projects.

## Features:

- clean flat design
- six bootstrap cards with image links to project sites
- modals that come from these cards to give more details, and link to live sites.
